<h1>Eric Speidel</h1>
<p>Hi! My name's Eric, and I am a computer scientist from Tübingen, Germany. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Informatik) and am currently pursuing my Masters degree at the University of Tübingen.
My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Self-Driving Cars, Embedded Systems and Cybersecurity. I want to shape the technology and living of the future, so keeping up with recent developments is a must.</p>
<p>This GitHub page is still very much under construction as I decide which of my works I want to share publicly here. I the mean time, why don't you visit my very own personal website/blog? :)</p>
